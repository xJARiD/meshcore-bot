"""Zero-hop neighbor discovery and scope collection.

Ported from the ``meshcore-packet-capture`` project's ``neighbors.py``, which is
itself a port of the observer firmware's ``WITH_MQTT_NEIGHBORS`` feature (see
``examples/simple_repeater/MyMesh.cpp``). Two stages per cycle:

1. A zero-hop node-discover request; repeaters answer with their pubkey and the
   SNR we heard them at. Responses are collected for a fixed window.
2. One anon-regions request per discovered neighbor, yielding that neighbor's
   scope names.

Both requests are issued through meshcore_py (``send_node_discover_req`` and
``req_regions_sync``); nothing here re-encodes packets.

Stage 1 is the valuable part for this bot: it produces a *confirmed direct RF
link* between two full 32-byte public keys, with a measured SNR. That is
stronger evidence than anything path inference can offer, and it costs one radio
command plus a passive listen window.

Stage 2 (scopes) is deliberately optional here and defaults off, for two reasons
that do not apply to the upstream capture tool:

* ``req_regions_sync`` awaits its reply inside the call, and every bot command
  is serialized through ``modules.core._SerializedCommands``, so one scope
  request holds the radio for its whole round trip -- stalling message sends.
* Upstream relies on a freshly discovered neighbor *not* being a known contact,
  which is what makes ``send_anon_req`` ask for a zero-hop reply path. This bot
  populates the library's contact cache. For a contact with no path
  (``out_path_len == -1``, the common case for a flood repeater) the library
  reaches zero-hop by calling ``change_contact_path()`` and then
  ``reset_path()`` -- i.e. it *mutates the device's contact table* per neighbor.
  Those two calls are not paired by ``try``/``finally`` upstream, so a request
  cut short between them leaves the contact pinned to zero-hop; collect_scopes
  restores it itself (see ``_restore_flood_path``).

No device-command lock is passed around: unlike upstream, every coroutine on
``meshcore.commands`` is already serialized and paced by
``modules.core._SerializedCommands``.
