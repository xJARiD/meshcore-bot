"""Dashboard statistics: daily rollups, the current-state snapshot, and readers.

The web viewer's landing page used to recompute ~50 aggregate queries on every
request, five times per page load.  This module moves that work off the request
path into a background refresher that writes two tables:

``daily_rollup``
    One row per local date.  Holds the metrics whose raw sources are pruned
    long before the dashboard's 30-day window — message/command/path stats at 7
    days, packet_stream at 3 — so trends outlive retention.  Signal metrics are
    stored as sums and counts, never means, so any window re-aggregates
    correctly.

``dashboard_snapshot``
    A single row of JSON describing current state, regenerated whole each tick.

Every method takes a ``sqlite3.Connection`` rather than owning one, so the
service unit-tests without Flask and the caller controls transaction scope.

Two conventions matter throughout:

* **NULL is not zero.**  A NULL column means "no source data for this day" and
  must render as a gap.  Writing 0 instead produces a fake cliff at the
  retention boundary that reads as an outage.
* **Local dates, clamped timestamps.**  Rollup dates are local to match
  ``daily_stats`` (the bot writes ``date('now','localtime')``), while the stats
  tables store UTC epochs.  Those tables also contain future-dated rows
  (observed up to year 2103), so every query clamps to now — otherwise the
  rollup grows a row for 2103 and the x-axis spans 77 years.
