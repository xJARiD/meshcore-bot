    The scheduled interval has a 12 hour floor (the firmware's band), which makes

    This is the bot's equivalent of the firmware's ``discover.neighbors``.

    A cycle takes at least ``neighbors_discover_window`` seconds — 60 by default —
    so this acknowledges immediately and reports the result in a second message
    rather than holding the reply open.

    Two cooldowns apply. ``cooldown_seconds`` is this sender's own, from the base
    class. The node-wide one belongs to the service (``MIN_CYCLE_GAP_SECONDS``),
    because airtime is spent by whichever trigger asks — the scheduler included —
    and it is only *reported* here, so the reply can say how long is left instead
    of failing opaquely.
